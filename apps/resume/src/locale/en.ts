    summary: `I have 9+ years of experience as a software developer, and am
          currently employed with Immosolve GmbH as a senior software engineer.
          I have worked with several different software stacks over multiple
          companies, and am a quick learner of new technologies. I am proficient
          at backend development, although I can also tackle front-end projects
          reliably. I find challenging projects exciting, and perform well under
          pressure.`,
